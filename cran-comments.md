-   This is a new version of the package.

Compared to the last version we:

-  Added a new function sf_flowmap which functions much like add_flowmap() but outputs the flows as spatial (sf) objects, allowing them to be easily exported and used in other visualisation tools (e.g., GIS).
-  Added a function add_flowmap_list() which allows for the creation of multiple, matching plots. This function will be improved in the future and we consider it to be experimental for now.
