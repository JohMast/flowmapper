# flowmapper

flowmapper allows to create ggplots with flowmaps in the style of <https://flowmap.gl/>.

## Installation

You can install the released version of flowmapper from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("flowmapper")
```

Or, you can install the development version of flowmapper like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/JohMast/flowmapper")
```

## Details

flowmapper uses a single function `add_flowmap` to add a flowmap layer to an existing ggplot. `add_flowmap` requires as inputs a single data.frame (or tibble) that contains for every combination of two nodes a and b

-   the x and y coordinates of each these nodes,

-   a unique id for each of these nodes,

-   the intensity of flow between those nodes in both directions (from a to b, and from b to a).

The data.frame should have the following columns:

```{r example}

testdata <-
data.frame(
   id_a = c("X1","X2","X3","X3","X1","X2","X2"),
   id_b = c("X5","X4","X1","X5","X4","X5","X3"),
   xa = c(2,14,10,10,2,14,14),
   ya = c(6,10,9,9,6,10,10),
   xb = c(10,4,2,10,4,10,10),
   yb = c(4,10,6,4,10,4,9),
   flow_ab = c(1,2,3,3,1,1,4),
   flow_ba = c(2,3,2,5,2,1,5)
)

```

The dataframe and the ggplot that the flowmap should be added to are then passed into `add_flowmap`.

```{r c2, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
plot <- ggplot() # empty ggplot

library(flowmapper)
plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata)+
  coord_equal()  # coord equal is highly recommended to create symmetric shapes
```

If the number of nodes is very high, the plot will appear cluttered. In that case, nodes can be clustered and merged by proximity, with `k_nodes` controlling the number of clusters.

```{r t1}
plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata,k_nodes = 4)+
  coord_equal()
```

Transparency and outline of the arrows can be controlled with the `outline_col` and `alpha` arguments.

```{r t3}
plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata, outline_col = "orange", alpha=0.5)+
  coord_equal()  # coord equal is highly recommended to create symmetric shapes
```

The flow arrows are geom_polygons, with the flow mapped to the fill aesthetic. Thus, the fill can be adjusted like for any geom.

```{r t4}
plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata)+
  coord_equal() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low="black", high = "red")
```

Size of the edges and offset (distance between two paired edges) can be controlled with `edge_width_factor` and `edge_offset_factor` .

```{r t5}
plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata, edge_offset_factor = 4, edge_width_factor = 2)+
  coord_equal()
```

Finally, the size of the nodes can be adjusted with `node_radius_factor`, and the distance between nodes and edges with `node_buffer_factor`.

```{r t6}

plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata, node_radius_factor = 2, node_buffer_factor = 0.5)+
  coord_equal()
```

Because the edges are polygons and not linked to an aesthetic, a typical ggplot legend cannot be created for their width. As an alternative, a legend can be added to the bottom of the main panel by using `add_legend` and `legend_col`.

```{r t7}
plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata,add_legend = "bottom",legend_col = "gray20")+
  coord_equal()
```

The flowmap can be turned into an interactive plot using the [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R) library. The names of the nodes and flows are mapped to the `text` aesthetic and can be used in the tooltips.

```{r t8, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(plotly)
plot <- 
  plot |>
  add_flowmap(testdata)+
  coord_equal()
ggplotly(plot,tooltip = c("text","fill"))
```

## Example

The code below shows an example of real world data from Switzerland (same data used in [this](https://www.flowmap.blue/15kwLB4baXZ7jpip8q0JjgR6zDoS5Gt3gMLCTUAboQxk?v=46.719075,7.817990,7.51&a=0&d=1&c=0&lt=1&col=Default&f=45) flowmap). The data contains migration flows between the 26 Cantons of Switzerland.

```{r t9}
library(dplyr,warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2,warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(sf)
library(flowmapper)

# load migration data
data <-
  flowmapper::CH_migration_data
head(data)
```

As a background for the flow map, a ggplot is created using the administrative boundaries, sourced from the [GADM](https://gadm.org/index.html) dataset.

```{r t10}
cantons <- flowmapper::cantons
st_crs(cantons) <- 3857

# basic plot with just the admin units
p <- ggplot(cantons)+
  geom_sf(fill=NA,col="gray30",linewidth=0.5) +
  ggdark::dark_theme_bw()+
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Migration in Switzerland 2016",
       caption = "Data: Federal Statistical Office, Switzerland")
p
```

The flowmap is then added to the base plot by using `add_flowmap`, applying some clustering to reduce the number of nodes from 26 to 10. A custom color scale is applied which matches the dark background.

```{r t11}
p2 <-
  p|>
  add_flowmap(flowdat = data,
              add_legend = "bottom",
              edge_width_factor = 0.7,
              k_nodes = 10,
              outline_col = NA)+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())+
  scale_fill_gradient("Migration",
                      low = "darkblue",
                      high="white")
p2
```

The flowmap uses the *color* and *fill* aesthetics, which can be limiting when the ggplot also should contain other layers using the same aesthetic. In such cases, the [ggnewscale](https://eliocamp.github.io/ggnewscale/) package can be used to enable a new scale for those aesthetics. The following example shows a flowmap being added to a basemap from the [basemaps](https://jakob.schwalb-willmann.de/basemaps/) package, which itself uses the *fill* aesthetic.

```{r t12}
library(basemaps)

p <- basemap_ggplot(cantons,
                    map_service = "esri",
                    map_type = "world_hillshade",
                    alpha=0.3)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank())+
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(0,0))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(0,0))+
  ggnewscale::new_scale_fill()+
  labs(title = "Migration in Switzerland 2016",
       caption = "Data: Federal Statistical Office, Switzerland")

p|>
  add_flowmap(flowdat = data,
              edge_width_factor = 0.7,k_nodes = 10,
              outline_col = NA)+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())+
  scale_fill_gradient("Migration",low = "gray",high="red")
```
